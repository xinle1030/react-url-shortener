## Backend
A URL shortener backend service like bit.ly and tinyurl.com.
The API service can take a long URL and convert it to a shorter URL as well as to provide a simple usage report tracking the number of clicks, originating geolocation and timestamp of each visit to a Short URL.

MongoDB is used as the database. 

The long URL, short URL, and other details such as metrics for each visit to the short url are stored in the database. When a long URL that is already stored in the database is passed again, it returns the older shortened URL. With each visit of url, the metrics are stored in the mongodb as well.

#### Required packages and their respective versions are specified in the package.json file under ./backend directory for installation

## Module Details:
The backend directory acts as a controller and holds the API endpoints of the application. It consists of two main functionalities:

1. Create New Link: Take a long URL and convert it to a shorter URL

2. For each link, it track the metrics such as number of clicks, originating geolocation and timestamp of each visit to a Short URL
